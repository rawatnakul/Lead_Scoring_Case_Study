# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
In this study, I have developed a logistic regression model to predict the conversion probability of leads for taking a course. This model will enable the sales team of the company to put more effort on potential targets and increase the conversion rate.
# Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. 
 Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. 
The lead conversion rate of the company is very poor. To make the lead conversion process more proficient, the company wants to identify the ‘Hot Leads’.
This will help the company to increase the conversion rate as the sales team will put more effort on converting the hot leads.
# Business Objective
The company ants us to build a model, wherein the customer with high lead score have high chances of conversion and vice versa.
The CEO has in particular given a target of 80%.
